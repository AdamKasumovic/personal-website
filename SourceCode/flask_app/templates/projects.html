                    simplified Trello project</a>.
                It is a simple version of the popular project management tool - Trello. A project management
                application like Trello allows team members of a project to come together and collaboratively decide,
                work on and track the progress of various listed tasks through the project's life cycle.
                Trello is a Kanban style application where progress of various project tasks can be easily
                understood by looking at visual representations. Make sure you're logged in before heading over!
