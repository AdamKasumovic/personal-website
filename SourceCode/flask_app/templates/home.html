                minors in Mathematics and Game
                Design at Michigan State University. My passions include helping others and programming. It is
                my ultimate goal in life to develop a piece of software that is widely-distributed and improves
                the lives of many.

                In the past I worked at IBM as a mainframe modernization application
                developer intern, where I was lucky enough to learn COBOL and JCL through IBM's internal
                learning system and meet many wonderful people. I was also given the opportunity to learn more
                modern technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes during my work using IBM cloud.

                My parents are both immigrants, and we used to visit family quite often.
                Because my family is so spread out across Europe and Asia, I have visited over 15 countries
                outside of North America!

                In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and video games, although as of late
                I have not had the time to do much of either. However, it is my final year, and I can
                finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. For now, I will just enjoy the ride.
